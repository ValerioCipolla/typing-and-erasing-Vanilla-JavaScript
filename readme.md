# Vanilla JavaScript automated typing and erasing

This simple javascript program "types" and "erases" in an endless loop a few words on the screen.

I tried to make the typing and erasing as realistic as possible introducing random times at wich the letters are typed and the cursor is moved.

Also, each word typed is in a different random color picked by a function in JavaScript.
